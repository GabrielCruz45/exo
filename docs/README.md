Exoplanet database analyzer web application tool for 2 (then more) scientists. This application was inspired by <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-S6GrwH6IQ>.

This world is huge and fills me with awe. This is one way I can bask in and experience it.

Will serve as a my final CS50 project and a precursor for my Data SCience and ML learning journey to come.
Also, for professional practice. (Using the tools and concepts for real world problems and usage).
