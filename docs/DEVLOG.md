# EXO DEVLOG

July 18, 2025

    Session 1:
    Started designing the project with an LLM as I currently need help on designing a complete application from start
    to deployment, due to lack of experience. Will write the instructions the LLM gives on the INSTRUCTIONS.md file
    in order to keep them handy throught the learning journey. Will write here what I do within each building session.

    Started project with folder structure and empty files, including README.md, DEVLOG.md, STRUCTURE_EXPLANATION.md and INSTRUCTIONS.md. Feeling excited and confident on the path ahead. Currently fighting "scope creep" with the LLM.

    Session 1:
    Started prompting the LLM to write Task files, simulating real world, professional experience. 
    Added dependencies to project in addition to requirements.txt. Edited config.py, moving on to extensions.py. Became aware of The Twelve-Factor app 'ethos'(?) -> https://12factor.net/

    Session 1:
    Started with TASK_THREE.pdf step 4. Found out through LLM a new way to think about classes, especially ones that you import: 
    "A class is like a template for creating objects." Also, just learned to use '#' on .md as H1 'tags'. ðŸ˜Ž

    Completed exo/app/auth/routes.py with full logic for registration, login and logout, including errors (using flash()!). 
    Initialized login_manager and wrote route to ensure protected routes and admin route(s). 
    General improvements to the structure and learned a little bit more of the "why's" regarding it. 
    Excited to continue working on this project and I am learning a LOT about application building!
