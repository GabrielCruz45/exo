    Session 1:
    Started designing the project with an LLM as I currently need help on designing a complete application from start
    to deployment, due to lack of experience. Will write the instructions the LLM gives on the INSTRUCTIONS.md file
    in order to keep them handy throught the learning journey. Will write here what I do within each building session.

    Started project with folder structure and empty files, including README.md, DEVLOG.md, STRUCTURE_EXPLANATION.md and INSTRUCTIONS.md. Feeling excited and confident on the path ahead. Currently fighting "scope creep" with the LLM.
